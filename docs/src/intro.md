# Introduction

Welcome to **Shrew**, a declarative tensor language and compiler designed for high-performance deep learning.

Shrew provides a clean, domain-specific language (DSL) for defining neural network architectures, training configurations, and inference pipelines. It decouples the model definition from the execution engine, allowing for powerful optimizations and multi-backend support (CPU, CUDA, TPU).

## Key Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define *what* your model is, not *how* to execute it.
- **Type Safety**: Strong static typing for tensor shapes and data types.
- **Graph Compilation**: Automatic graph construction, optimization, and scheduling.
- **Modularity**: Composable blocks for models, configuration, and data pipelines.

## Getting Started

Check out the [DSL Guide](dsl/index.md) to learn the language, or browse the [Examples](dsl/examples.md) to see Shrew in action.
